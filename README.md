COVID-19 data Overview
          
We collect information from several reliable sources, like Johns
Hopkins CSSE, CDC, WHO and a few others. All our sources are
verified, and we avoid collecting information that is not confirme
by official authorities. Every country sends official reports
differently. From once per day to every hour. That depends on the
scale of the pandemic and the time zone. Nevertheless, we are trying
to update every new information ASAP. If you have a specific wish,
please let us know (Discussions), and we will try to put it on our
road map. This is a non-profit humanitarian project, and all the
money we get goes for better servers, data providers and other
expenses for providing you with a better, faster and more reliable
API. Stay safe.
